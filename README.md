About the Project
==============================================================================================================================
 I have been involved in coding for several years but recently found a need to update my skills
 
 For this project I focused on a simple and (to be honest a little archaic) form of Node.js and Backbone.js
 
 Look forward to updates on a more fully function client facing backbone app and full server node work
 
 THE FIRST QUESTION.....THE QUESTION YOU HAVE BEEN RUNNING FROM ALL YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!
 ==============================================================================================================================

For those of you who managed to pick up the refernce ..... good for you

This project is actually focused on a question I find incredibly difficult...Where do you want to live?

In this age we have information all over about statistics and area crime rates, but what are the intangibles about the areas
we choose to live, from quality of life, to getting along with our neighbors I want to (slowly) tackle this problem
but mainly want myself and others to end up in the best place that suits our own unique style and needs.
